In my analysis, I tried to create a predictive model for estimating restaurant tips based on billing and demographic details. Here’s an overview of the workflow and insights gained:

Firstly, I loaded the data, and explored to understand its structure. Then i created various visualizations, such as scatter and box plots, to analyze patterns in tips with respect to features like 'total_bill', 'day', 'time', and 'party size'. The correlation matrix and pair plot shows the relationships among the numeric variables, particularly showing that 'total_bill' correlates with 'tip'.

Then i did the Data Preprocessing step. For this i standardized the Numerical features, and one-hot encoded the categorical features (like 'sex', 'day', 'smoker', etc.)
Then i splitted the data into training and test sets for model evaluation.

To train the model, i used Various regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR, and KNN namely)
I evaluated them using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, and cross-validation scores to assess their prediction accuracy. The Ridge regression model performed the best, providing the highest R² score and robust performance across cross-validation folds.

I did the Feature Importance Analysis using Random Forest. It showed that the 'total_bill', 'size', and 'time' are significant predictors of tip amounts. This insight indicates that these features should be central to strategies for improving service and predicting tips and are very important.

Also, i did the Residual Analysis to ensure the model’s accuracy, confirming that errors were randomly distributed around zero with no issues, indicating that the model fit the data well.

Key Findings and Insights:
-Best Model: Ridge regression model showed the best predictive performance.
Important Factors: 'total_bill', 'size', and 'time' were the most influential features.
Management Recommendations: 
-Focus on Total Bill**: The amount of the bill strongly influences tips, suggesting that upselling or managing bill size could impact tipping.
 -Consider Party Size: Larger parties might tip differently, so service could be tailored for larger groups.
-Optimize During Peak Times: Identifying patterns in tipping behavior by time of day can help optimize staffing and customer service during high-tipping periods.

This model predicts the tipping behavior, hence will enhance the customer service and optimizing restaurant operations.
Also it was fun to work on this assignment since it was really a good means to practice what has been taught to us.
